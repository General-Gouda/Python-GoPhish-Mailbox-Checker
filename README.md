# Python-GoPhish-Mailbox-Checker
This program will check a mailbox within Office 365 for the presense of emails sent from Gophish, extract the phishing URL, transform it into a reporting URL, send a simple HTTP GET to the url to mark it as reported within Gophish, then mark the email item as read, flagged complete and categorized.
